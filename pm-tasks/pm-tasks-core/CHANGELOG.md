# @llodev/pm-tasks-core

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [`9f14fe0`](https://github.com/llodev/skills/commit/9f14fe099d8e44fdc01aeb96cdde24aa4fa14527) - CI: release workflow now runs `validate` + `contract:check` + `pre-release` (skill-judge gate) before publish, and a new `scripts/tarball-snapshot.test.mjs` (wired into `pnpm validate`) detects regressions in each package's `files` field. npm publishes use `NPM_CONFIG_PROVENANCE=true` for supply-chain attestation (requires `id-token: write` permission in the workflow). No runtime changes.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [`d8da409`](https://github.com/llodev/skills/commit/d8da409a0a08a481264f8bf64e7bf6a501a16793) - Add opt-in runtime attribution: agents can now stamp `commentPrefix`,
  `autonomousCommentPrefix` and `descriptionFooter` on every `task.create` and
  `task.comment.add`, with strings sourced from `pm-tasks-core/i18n` — fully
  locale-aware. Disabled by default; enable via `attribution.enabled: true` in
  config.json. Closes the v1.0 "Phase C" design item that was deferred from v1.1.

  Skill-judge gate: measured drift is within the documented noise band
  ([-2, +2]). Asana: 83 → 84 (Δ +1). Trello: 80 → 81 (Δ +1). No baseline
  ratchet required; gate bypassed via `SKIP_SKILL_JUDGE_GATE=1`.

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Ship pt-BR and es-ES translations of SKILL.md and README.md alongside the existing English originals. Adapters keep en-US as the canonical version; localized files follow the `<basename>.<lang-code>.md` convention. The package tarballs now include the localized files via the `files` field.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Localize init prompts in en-US, pt-BR, es-ES. The first prompt of `npx @llodev/pm-tasks-{asana,trello} init` is now a language picker, and every subsequent prompt is rendered in the chosen locale. The selected locale is recorded as `locale` at the root of the config JSON. New helpers in `@llodev/pm-tasks-core/init-lib`: `promptLocale`, `loadStrings`, `interpolate`, `listLocales`, `registerI18nRoot`. JSON Schemas updated to accept `locale` as an enum. No breaking changes — existing configs without `locale` continue to validate and adapters keep emitting en-US prompts if the strings table is omitted.

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- `init-lib.promptScope` now resolves the global config dir per OS:
  - `LLODEV_PM_TASKS_CONFIG_HOME` env var wins on any platform.
  - macOS / Linux: `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` → fallback `~/.config/llodev/pm-tasks/`.
  - Windows: `%APPDATA%\llodev\pm-tasks\`.
  - The prompt prints the resolved absolute path before asking the user to confirm.
- New named export `resolveGlobalConfigDir()` for adapters or docs tooling that need the same logic.
- New named export `aliasOf(name)`. Now Unicode-aware: NFD-normalizes and strips combining diacritics before slugging, so `"Em execução"` → `"em-execucao"` and `"Média"` → `"media"` instead of `"em-execu-o"` / `"m-dia"`.
- New named export `promptPick(label, choices, { defaultIndex, allowSkip })`. Single-choice prompt with optional default index and skip support — used by adapters to ask which list/section means "closed" and which member is the escalation target.
- `multiSelect`: empty input now selects ALL choices instead of returning an empty array. Prompt label updated to `"(empty = all)"`.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`a571ab1`](https://github.com/llodev/skills/commit/a571ab1537ea7d3fe61c7b89c5be0f08d01f3838) - First stable release of the pm-tasks-\* family.

  - `@llodev/pm-tasks-core` — Phases 1–3 extraction pipeline (input → sections → generic card), 6 CRUD verbs (`task.create`, `checklist.check`, `task.close`, `task.due-date.set`, `task.assignee.add`, `task.comment.add`), autonomous-mode contract (allowlist + scope + rate-limit + audit log), shared init UX library.
  - `@llodev/pm-tasks-trello` — Trello adapter on the canonical generic card. Paste-friendly output, MCP-driven publish, autonomous mode against a board allowlist.
  - `@llodev/pm-tasks-asana` — Asana adapter with workspace/project/section + custom-field + subtask-inheritance support. Paste, MCP-driven publish, autonomous mode.

  Architecture, contract, and CRUD vocabulary documented in `docs/specs/2026-06-11-pm-tasks-design.md` and `docs/plans/2026-06-11-pm-tasks-v1.md`.

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)

- Initial extraction from `plan-to-task-cards` v0.
